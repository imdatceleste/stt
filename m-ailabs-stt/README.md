# RUNNING the SR Engine
This repository contains the code to run an Speech-Recognition server and a client to test it.

Currently, it only supports .WAV-files: you can use the ``test_client.py`` to send a .wav-file to the server.

The response is a JSON-structure containing the transcription.

Please check out your Confluence documentation for how to run it.

You also need a trained model to test it.
